# TicTacToe-Game
This is a simple TicTacToe game without a gui, just a simple display of the game functional in the console.
There are a few functions involved:
1. PrintBoard() - prints updated board
2. PlayerInput() - player chooses a index on the board
3. CheckWin() - checks to see if a player won or if there is a tie
4. SwitchPlayer() - switches players each round
These will run as long as game_running is true. game_running will be false when there is a ending condition for the game.
